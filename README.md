# Random Password Generator Python

A simple password generator script in Python that allows users to generate secure passwords based on their preferences for including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

## Features

- **Customizable Character Sets**: Users can choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Password Length and Quantity**: Users can specify the length of each password and the number of passwords to generate.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using a Python interpreter.

    ```bash
    python password_generator.py
    ```

2. **Follow the Prompts**: The script will ask if you want to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols in your passwords. Respond with `Y` for Yes or `N` for No.

3. **Specify Password Length and Quantity**:
    - Enter the desired length of the password.
    - Enter the number of passwords you want to generate.

4. **View Generated Passwords**: The script will output the generated passwords based on your specified criteria.

## Example

```bash
    Do you want to include uppercase letters? [Y/N]: Y 
    Do you want to include lowercase letters? [Y/N]: Y 
    Do you want to include numbers? [Y/N]: N 
    Do you want to include symbols? [Y/N]: Y 
    
    Enter the length of password: 12 
    Enter the number of passwords you want to generate: 3
    
    Password 1: @Xz#7!LkA$1^ 
    Password 2: +T%w^J3&b*9< 
    Password 3: !a^7Bk#2D&@%
```


## Note

- The script automatically adjusts the password length if it exceeds the number of available characters.
- Make sure to enter valid positive integers for the password length and the number of passwords.
